                      <div class="serv2"><h3>Painting or staining your deck is a difficult DIY job. Home owners <br>do paint or stain their decks, but it is difficult. It requires specific<br> tools and experience to do it properly.<br>

                        When you start thinking about refinishing your deck, make sure<br> you consider everything that is involved
                         in this project:<br><br>
                        
                        *Deck Cleaning. Cleaning is everything from sweeping the deck<br>boards to power washing with a pressure washer,
                         using a deck <br>cleaner, and removing any peeling paint.<br><br>
                        *Sanding. For a nice smooth and even wood surface, that a coat <br>of stain can adhere to, it’s important to sand.<br><br>
                        *Preparing. Prep the area and exterior surfaces by marking off<br>edges with painters tape. You’ll also want to
                         prepare your paint <br>or stain and have all of your materials ready, like trays, rollers,<br> and paint pads.<br><br>
                        *Apply stain or paint.<br><br>
                       *Wait for the paint or stain to dry by following the instructions<br> on the product label.<br><br>
                        As you can see, tackling this project by yourself is a lot. Hiring a professional is an easy way to make 
                        sure it gets done on time. Moreover, having a professional do it, makes sure that your deck is finished properly.
                        
                        A good finish on your deck, not only improves its appearance, but it also protects it. This is good for 
                        your home and your money.</h3></div>
                        <div class="deck5"><img src="Gallery/deck5.jpg" width="700" height="510"></div>
                        <div class="stain"><h1>Deck Staining</h1></div>
                        <div class="stain2"><h3>Stains work well on decks, such as PPG’s ProLuxe in a transparent, semitransparent, or solid finish.
                             Stains are typically less slippery for deck surfaces and highlight the
                              natural wood grain, but they need to be applied more regularly than paint

                            Because decks are continually exposed to harsh conditions during the year, it’s
                             important and even necessary to make sure they are appropriately stained and regularly 
                             refinished to ensure that your deck will last for years to come.</h3></div>
                             <div class="paint"><h1>Deck Painting</h1></div>
                             <div class="paint2"><h3>Deck painting is a famous weekend project. But with unlimited paint colors to choose from and
                                  varying paint finishes, it is important to know where to start.

                                Though stain is more common with decks, for deck paint, we recommend going with a natural finish
                                 and an acrylic-base because it requires less maintenance than oil-based paint and has a UV-resistant film.
                                 Also, acrylic paints are resistant to mildew, and acrylic latex resin paints expand and contract
                                  with the varying temperatures.</h3></div>
