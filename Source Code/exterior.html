                             When deciding to paint your house, often one of the first steps is to choose your<br> paint color. 
                             There are many elements to consider when choosing which<br>
                              color to paint the exterior of your house.<br><br>

                            Landscape – Your environment will influence which paint colors you wish to
                             paint<br> on the exterior. If your house is covered by a lot of shade, you may
                              consider a<br> lighter color. However, if you wish to blend into the trees, you 
                              may want a darker <br>color. It’s critical to think about how you want your home’s<br>
                               exterior to complement<br> its environment.<br><br>
                            Architecture – Perhaps you have a Victorian-style house or a traditional 
                            colonial. They are both very different architectural styles with different
                             peaks and accents.<br> However your home is built, colors can help draw attention to
                              specific architectural details.<br><br>
                            Existing Colors – Your roof, your driveway, your gravel, your mulch are not going
                             to change colors when you paint. Consider how you want your exterior house paint<br> 
                              colors to accent these features of your home.</h3></div>

                                There is a lot that goes into painting the exterior of a house.
                                 It will likely take<br> longer than a weekend. So if you aren’t prepared to
                                  handle the following, you<br> may want to hire a professional to handle all 
                                  of your house painting needs.<br><br>

                                Wash – Before painting, the exterior of your house will need to be washed.
                                 You<br> can use a pressure washer to do this. It’s best when you start at the
                                  top so all <br>of the dirt and grime will go down off the siding and trim.<br>
                                Scrape – Next, it’s important to scrape any loose paint off of the siding of
                                 the house.<br>It’s important to have drop cloths below where you work so these
                                  paint chips don’t<br> land in the grass.<br><br>
                                Sand – Sanding is a necessary step to smooth the exterior surfaces and create
                                 an <br>ideal surface for the paint to adhere to.<br><br>
                                Patch – If there are any remaining areas that need repair, they’ll need to be
                                 patched <br>up before the exterior is primed.<br><br>
                                Prime – Next the surface will need to be primed. Each prime is different. The
                                 paint <br>manufacturer will indicate how many coats are needed.<br><br>
                                Caulk – Seal all of the cracks and corners so no moister will seep through.<br>
                                Paint – Finally, it’s time to paint the house in the color of your choice.</h3></div>
